# Final-Project-PIC10C

I will be posting screen shots, descriptions and comments about my progress in my video game!


Today I made my first scene, I created two spheres and a ground.
I added some physics features to my spheres so that they fall on the box with gravity.
They can also bounce off each other.
What I love about Unity is that I can change the sphere's settings (for example its weight) while the scene (game) is playing, and I can see the changes live!

Today I added C# code and I create a function that pushes my sphere!
