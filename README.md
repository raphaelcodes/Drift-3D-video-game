# Final-Project-PIC10C

I will be posting screen shots, descriptions and comments about my progress in my video game!


Today I made my first scene, I created two spheres and a ground.
I added some physics features to my spheres so that they fall on the box with gravity.
They can also bounce off each other.
What I love about Unity is that I can change the sphere's settings (for example its weight) while the scene (game) is playing, and I can see the changes live!

Today I added C# code and I create a function that pushes my sphere!

Today I made my player (blue sphere) move with my keyboard.
I can change the force.

Here is my C# code for movement:

GIF: I finally made the camera follow the player. I can also make it follow the player without seeing the player (first person).

Here is my first game play:
I added obstacles, and whenever the player touches an obstacle the play will not moving.

I added a text to keep track of the score:

I added some music!

I published my game on itch.io
